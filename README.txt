Project 4:
Facebook Part 1

Good afternoon,

In order to build and run the project type the following commands in this order:

On first terminal:
    sbt "run-main Server.Router"

On second terminal:
    sbt "run-main Client.Main numClients"

where numClients is a positive integer.


User Instructions:

    After the program is running, enter a number between 0 to numClients-1 on the client terminal to listen to that client's activity

    Please include the quotation marks as well.


Note: If you don't enter in numClients it will default to 1000 clients.

All features are implemented and working. Output will be displayed in the client terminal.

Enjoy.
